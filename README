* BASIC USAGE:

hdrprep.pl -a img1.jpg img2.jpg img3.jpg

This will create new directory aligned with aligned and cropped images
You can use also -q flag for jpg quality and use wildcards (*)
so the command can looks like:

hdrprep.pl -a -q 95 *

another dependency not mentioned here is PerlMagick, but it seems, that imagemagick
in Arch Linux is allready compiled with this capability.

* PROBLEM with rotation
script doesn't consider rotation among images, so keep it in mind

* HW requirements:
depending of size of images it can take from few through tens of minutes to process.
512 MB RAM would be appropriate, unles you are processing small images.
